// How many times will the following loops execute, and what will each loop print out:

// a.) An infinite loop of 0 being printed out and I had to quit my terminal. The MacBook almost didn't
//     let me XD.

// b.)

/*
var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++; // note same as i = i + 1;
}
 
Terminal prints:
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
*/

// c.) 

/*
var numberList = [1,2,3,4];
for (var number of numberList) {
    console.log(number);
}

var numberList loops in an ordered list.
1
2
3
4

Very cool!
